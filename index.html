        My interviewees all agree that in person meeting is a critical step

      </div>
      <div class="descriptionContent">
        Although I saw from my research that in real life meet ups is very
        important and a crucial step before relationships are formed, I've
        conducted interviews with 20 users between the ages of 20-35. I've asked
        them questions below to find trends on why they prefer to meet someone
        in real life.

      <div class="descriptionContent descriptionContentBold">
        Interview Questions

      <div class="descriptionContent interviewQuestions">
        1. How many people do you end up meeting after matching on previous
        dating apps?<br />
        2. Out of the people that you meet up with, how many do you continue to
        keep in contact?<br />
        3. What are you motives for joining a dating app?<br />
        4. Which dating app do you use the most?<br />
        5. Have you met up with anyone through a dating app?<br />
        6. What would make you feel more comfortable to meet up?<br />
        7. What would you change about the current dating app you use?<br />
        8. What makes you stop using the dating app?<br />

      <div class="descriptionContent descriptionContentBold">
        The Main Insight:
      </div>

      <div class="descriptionContent descriptionContentBold">
        My interviewees did not find success in previous dating apps because the
        core task of the app was to match you with compatible people but there
        were no initiatives for in real life meet ups.
      </div>
      <div class="descriptionContent">
        Based on the trends that I found after the interview and surveys, I
        found that the majority of successful relationships must have an in real
        life component. All of the interviewers said that even when
        conversations are going well, not all matches will initiate a meeting in
        real life. Most felt overwhelmed by the amount of matches and
        conversations made.

            Kimberly is a 25 year old auditor working at Deloitte accounting
            firm in San Francisco. She spends most of her days at work and
            overtime is not out of the ordinary, therefore meeting partners
            through a dating app works best for her. Kimberly loves going to
            local restaurants and trying out new food around her office in
            downtown San Francisco. She loves meeting new people and engaging in
            genuine conversation. She is happy with her career trajectory and
            just purchased a condo. She is not looking for a serious
            relationship to share her life with.

            While designing the app with a focus to reduce friction between
            online and in real life transition for matches to meet up, there
            were other aspects such as matchmaking algorithms, safety features
            and app tone of voice that needs to be aligned with user needs for
            the app to be successful.Â

            When designing the app I put focus on creating a simple and less
            friction onboarding process while trading off security and trust for
            users. After analyzing the research and user interviews/survey I
            found that people put trust and honesty as a high priority when it
            comes to dating apps.Â
